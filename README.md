Note: When you working with swgeer locally, you have to define the cores configuration.
Here, I use 3rd part extension to bypass it.

 Name : Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin - Easily add (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *) rule to the response heade

 The Structure design is covered the following areas: 
The architecture there are 2 separate entities:
•	User: User has 2 roles barber and customer.
•	Reservation: After logging information user can add booking information to system.
•	Search info: handle special search criteria (By name and date)
Also, following areas are covered:

Some mandatory routes: 
•	to get all the reservations from the calendar
•	to add new reservation to your calendar
•	to update existing reservation in the calendar
to remove the reservation or multiple reservations from the calendar


To search the reservations by using different search criteria
•	based on service provided by the customer
•	based on customer name
•	based on the time period

Optional parts
Optional part: To partially update reservation in the calendar: done
changing customer name etc.: done 


note: All REST APIS are working fine and functional working as expected!
